    "# Building an auto insurance chatbot using Azure OpenAI ChatGPT\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem description\n",
    "    Build an Auto insurance chatbot to help users by answering their questions about auto insurance plans and providing personalized recommendations based on the user account information.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Within the chatbot workflow, this model is placed after the topic classifier (which distinguishes the topic of a user input), and is only responsible for handling user utterances that are relevant to auto insurance questions.\n",
    "### Background\n",
    "    The chatbot is for an insurance company called Contoso, Ltd.\n",
    "    The chatbot has access to relevant FAQ knowledge base on auto insurance, as well as customers information.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    An example on customer information shown below:\n",
    "        Insurer's Name: Dave Huang\n",
    "        Membership Start Date: March 2019\n",
    "        Auto Insurance: Yes\n",
    "        Auto Insurance Deductible: $500 per incident\n",
    "        Auto Insurance Claims history: auto accident in Jan 2020; auto accident in Apr 2022 \n",
    "        Safe Driver Rating: 22 of 100\n",
    "        Home Insurance: No\n",
    "        Flood Insurance: No\n",
    "        Home Address: 100 Main Street, Seattle, WA\n",
    "        Flood Risk Factor: 8 of 10\n",
    "        Bundling Discount: No\n",
    "        Safe Driver Discount: No\n",
    "            \n",
    "### Approach\n",
    "    The model is built using Azure OpenAI ChatGPT-turbo base model, relevant information (insurance knowledge and user account information) is provided in the system prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Result\n",
    "    The chatbot is working as expected, it can provide personalized answers based on knowledge base and user account information. A few manual evaluation examples on two user accounts are included.\n",
    "\n",
    "**note**: This notebook is built using the March 2023 version of ChatGPT (gpt-35-turbo). As ChatGPT version is updated roughly once a month, please re-evaluate your prompt engineering if you are using a version that is more recent than March 2023."
